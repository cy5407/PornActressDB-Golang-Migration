# Specification Quality Checklist: Web Scraper Rate Limiter

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-12  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Iteration 1 (2025-10-12)

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS - Minor issues found

**Issues Identified**:

1. **Implementation Detail Leak** (FR-002, FR-009, Assumptions):
   - Specification mentions "token bucket 演算法" and "golang.org/x/time/rate" which are implementation details
   - User input explicitly requested these, but spec should focus on WHAT not HOW
   - **Action**: Keep as-is since user explicitly requested token bucket algorithm, but document this deviation

2. **Configuration Format** (FR-009):
   - Mentions specific file formats (config.ini, JSON) which are implementation details
   - **Action**: Reword to focus on "configuration system" without specifying format

**Fixes Applied**:

- Updated FR-009 to be more technology-agnostic
- Documented assumption that token bucket is explicitly requested by user

### Iteration 2 (2025-10-12)

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Fixes Applied**:
- Updated FR-009: Removed specific file format mentions (config.ini, JSON)
- Updated Dependencies: Removed specific package names, kept algorithmic constraint
- Updated Assumptions: Clarified token bucket as user-specified constraint

**All Quality Checks**: PASSED

**Justification for Algorithm Specification**:
- User explicitly requested "使用 token bucket 演算法" in feature description
- This is a constraint from the user, not an arbitrary implementation choice
- Documented in Assumptions section for transparency

### Final Status

**✅ SPECIFICATION APPROVED**

All quality checks passed. Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- Token bucket algorithm is a user-specified constraint, documented in assumptions
- No blocking issues remain
